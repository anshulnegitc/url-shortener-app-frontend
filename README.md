# Url Shortener Application

It's an imitation of **Url Shortener Service.**

Only **functional requirements** are considered while developing this project i.e **to generate short url and redirect short url to original url.**

In case url got expired/moved to other domain/not responsding, a 404 error page is shown.

**Redis is used as primary as well as caching database here.**

Some analytics and expression values(like,star,thumbs up etc...) are permanently stored in database while urls are short lived.

**Application Architecture.**

## How it works

### How the data is stored:

* Urls.
    * It maps the long_url with short_url.
    * short_url is base62 value of counter and is indexed.
    * Expiration of 30 mins is set.
    * Data is stored as
````
class Url extends Entity { }
const urlSchema = new Schema(Url, {
    long_url: { type: 'string' },
    short_url: { type: 'string', indexed: true }
});
client.execute(['EXPIRE', `Url:EntityId`, 1800]);
````

* Counter.
    * Stores the expression(visitor count,links redirected,links generated, heart,like,star and counter range).
    * It permanently stores data and increment the count on respective operation.
    * * As total visitor to a website is stored as `{entityId:"something",name:'visitor',count:2}`
    * * And so on for every count on website.
````
class Counter extends Entity { }
const counterSchema = new Schema(Counter, {
    name: { type: 'string', indexed: true },
    count: { type: 'number' },
});
counterEntity = await CounterRepository().fetch(id);
counterEntity.entityData.count += 1;
CounterRepository().save(counterEntity);
````

* Continent.
    * Stores continent wise analytics on the website.
    * It permanently stores data and increment the count of the fields on respective operation.
    * On respective operation continent name is fetched and incremented the operation count.
    * If on initial phase no continent is found then it creates a new one.
    * * Data is stored as `{entityId:"",name:'Asia',links_gen:2,links_redirect:1,visitor:12}`
````
class Continent extends Entity { }
const continentSchema = new Schema(Continent, {
    name: { type: 'string', indexed: true },
    links_gen: { type: 'number' },
    links_redirect: { type: 'number' },
    visitor: { type: 'number' },
});
let continentEntity = ContinentRepository().search().where('name').equals(result.continent).return.all();
if (continentEntity.length) {
    continentEntity[0].entityData[[type]] += 1;
    ContinentRepository().save(continentEntity[0]);
} else {
    const entity = ContinentRepository().createEntity();
    entity.name = result.continent;
    entity.visitor = 1;
    entity.links_gen = 0;
    entity.links_redirect = 0;
    ContinentRepository().save(entity);
}
````
    
### How the data is accessed:


* Urls.
    * Code is base62 counter value.
    * On success it redirect to the original url and on failure 404 page.
````
url=UrlRepository().search().where('short_url').equals(code).return.first();
In place of all we can use first also
````

* Expression.
    * A list is fetched, which has count of visitor, link generated, links redirected, thumbs up, like and heart except the counter range.
````
const records = CounterRepository().search().where('name').not.eq('range').return.all();
````

* Continent.
    * For desktop view individual continents analytics are fetched by continent name and for mobile view a list of continents are fetched.
````
records = await ContinentRepository().search().where('name').equals(c).return.all();
````

````
records = await ContinentRepository().search().return.all();
````
